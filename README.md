# Tree-Visualizer
Tree Visualizer is a web-based visualization tool built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js that helps users understand and explore three important data structures in DSA (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms)

The user inputs an array, and the tool dynamically visualizes the corresponding tree structures based on the selected operation. This project is especially useful for students and beginners who want to get a visual intuition of how tree-based data structures work.

Features
✅ Input-based visualization: Enter an array and view the tree transformation instantly.

🌳 Binary Tree Display: Nodes filled from left to right, top to bottom.

🔍 Binary Search Tree (BST): Sorted binary structure, left-child smaller, right-child larger.

🏔️ Max-Heap: Heapify function creates a max-heap structure from the input array.

🖼️ SVG Visual Output: Uses D3.js to generate interactive and scalable visual elements.

💡 UI Elements: Simple and clean interface with labeled input, interactive buttons, and styled visuals

Tech Stack
HTML – Page structure and inputs

CSS – UI styling and layout

JavaScript – Functionality, interactivity, and tree construction

D3.js – SVG-based data visualization
